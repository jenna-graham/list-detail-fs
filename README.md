## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**

1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
## a div with a class of children
1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?** 
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")** 
## i need the div in order to call my renderChild function
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)**
 
1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change? Does any DOM update?**
1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done. (Hint: console.log usually helps here.)** 
## TDD function to test if it works 
1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**
## create a list of my children, add names, age, favorite food, and another list within that list of their hobbies.
## create a function that will render the objects in my domain of children. 
## test the function to be sure it works
## export function find by ID 
## create a new page for the details page on site/ create new folder with js and html for new page.
## use URLSearchParams to get more data about the web page



Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
